    <section>
      <p>In recent years, <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span> has transitioned from a buzzword to a <strong>business-critical tool</strong>‚Äînot just for tech giants, but for <span class="highlight">small businesses</span> around the world. With the increasing accessibility of AI-powered tools and platforms, small businesses are uniquely positioned to <strong>innovate, automate, and compete</strong> on a whole new level.</p>

      <p>In this article, we‚Äôll explore how AI is reshaping small business operations in 2025, and highlight key areas where AI can make an immediate impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why AI Is No Longer Just for Big Tech</h2>
      <p>Historically, <span class="highlight">AI solutions</span> were seen as expensive, complex, and out of reach for small businesses. But with open-source models, low-code tools, and affordable platforms, <strong>AI is now more accessible than ever</strong>.</p>

      <p>Thanks to cloud-based APIs and plug-and-play services, small businesses can:</p>

        <li>Automate routine tasks</li>
        <li>Personalize customer experiences</li>
        <li>Optimize operations</li>
        <li>Make data-driven decisions</li>
      </ul>
